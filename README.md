# PHP Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: division by zero. The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.

The original code attempts to divide a number by zero, resulting in a warning.  The solution adds error handling to gracefully manage this situation.
